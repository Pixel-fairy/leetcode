my solution 
# The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
# The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

SELECT query_name, 
    ROUND((SUM(rating/position)/COUNT(query_name)),2) AS quality,            
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,2) AS poor_query_percentage 
FROM Queries 
GROUP BY query_name
;
