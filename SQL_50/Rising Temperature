id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

## my solution

SELECT W1.id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2
ON DATEDIFF(W1.recordDate, W2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;

## optimized solution

Select w1.id 
from weather w1
Join weather w2
On w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, Interval 1 day)
where w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
