##Question
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


## my solution

class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Split the string by spaces to remove extra spaces
        words = s.split()
        
        # Reverse the list of words
        words.reverse()
        
        # Join the words with a single space and return
        result = " ".join(words)
        return result


##optimized solution

class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        word = s.split()
        return " ".join(word[::-1])
