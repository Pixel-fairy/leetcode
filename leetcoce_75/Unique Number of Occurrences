## Question
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

## first iteration
the i=j 
updating the repeting only 
[1 ,2] not repeating == not recorded (0==0 nothin to equate) == true (as answer)

## my solution

from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        my_dict = defaultdict(int)

        # Count the occurrences of each element
        for i in arr:
            my_dict[i] += 1

        # Check if occurrences are unique
        seen = set()
        for value in my_dict.values():
            if value in seen:
                return False
            seen.add(value)
            
        return True
